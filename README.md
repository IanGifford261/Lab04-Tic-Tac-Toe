## Description

This is a C# console game that is tic tac toe. Two players can name themselves and following the prompts can begin a game. Using a multidimensional array which is the game board, the users can select a number that corresponds to a location on the board. Alternating turns allows the users to switch every turn until either a winning condition is met, or a draw happens and no winner is declared.
